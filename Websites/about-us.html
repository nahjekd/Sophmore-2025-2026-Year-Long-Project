        Berenice is a character in the webtoon <i>"Nevermore"</i>, she isn't really shown much as of the current story. However she is in the group called the misfits, which is made up of 5 people that are usually causing problems in their class or school. Breaking rules they are supposed to because it causes the dean's problems and she doesn't like them.

            In her original story by Edgar Allan Poe, Bernice is wedded with her cousin who tends to have a fixation on certain things while she has an illness where her body breaks down. One day he sees her teeth and has thoughts of pulling them out, later on she dies and all we read that he goes to her body and pulls out her teeth. The next day one of the servants said that her grave had been disturbed and that she was still alive. Next to him (the narrator) was a shovel with a box of 32 of her teeth.
